randomization mechanism, I provide a series of tests that compare aspects of the treatment and control groups to assess whether they are statistically significantly different from one another.\n\n#_todo: test a few variables other than the key outcome variables (for example, test months since last donation) to see if the treatment and control groups are statistically significantly different at the 95% confidence level. Do each as a t-test and separately as a linear regression, and confirm you get the exact same results from both methods. When doing a t-test, use the formula in the class slides. When doing the linear regression, regress for example mrm2 on treatment and look at the estimated coefficient on the treatment variable. It might be helpful to compare parts of your analysis to Table 1 in the paper.

The model tells us that:\nPeople who were offered a match were more likely to donate than those who weren’t. This difference, while small, is statistically significant — meaning it’s unlikely to have happened by random chance. In plain terms: offering a match nudges more people into action.\nEven though the actual increase in donation probability is modest, it is consistent across a large sample and enough to be detectable with statistical tools. This supports the idea that small behavioral cues — like knowing your gift will be matched — can meaningfully change human behavior.\n\n#_todo: run a probit regression where the outcome variable is whether any charitable donation was made and the explanatory variable is assignment to treatment or control.

This finding confirms that behavioral nudges like match offers can shape real-world decisions, even when the actual incentive is small.\n\n\nDifferences between Match Rates\nNext, I assess the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations on the response rate.\n\n#_todo: Use a series of t-tests to test whether the size of the match ratio has an effect on whether people donate or not. For example, does the 2:1 match rate lead increase the likelihood that someone donates as compared to the 1:1 match rate?

Dummy variables for ratio2 and ratio3 (with ratio1 as the baseline), 2. A factor variable for match ratio (same result, just different syntax).\nThe base group is those who received a 1:1 match offer. The coefficients are very small (under 0.2 percentage points), and The p-values are well above 0.05, meaning the differences are not statistically significant.\nPeople who received a 2:1 or 3:1 match were not more likely to donate than those who received a 1:1 match. The regression confirms that increasing the match ratio doesn’t meaningfully change behavior.\nThese findings support the paper’s conclusion: the presence of a match increases giving, but larger match sizes don’t matter.\nThis insight has practical value for fundraisers: there’s no added benefit to offering a more generous match ratio — just having a match is what counts.\n\n#_todo: Calculate the response rate difference between the 1:1 and 2:1 match ratios and the 2:1 and 3:1 ratios.  Do this directly from the data, and do it by computing the differences in the fitted coefficients of the previous regression. what do you conclude regarding the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations?_\n\n# Subset only the treatment group\nmatch_data &lt;- filter(data, treatment == 1)\n\n# Create readable match ratio labels\nmatch_data &lt;- match_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(ratio_group = case_when(\n    ratio2 == 1 ~ \"2:1\",\n    ratio3 == 1 ~ \"3:1\",\n    TRUE ~ \"1:1\"\n  ))\n\n# Compute response rates\nresponse_rates &lt;- match_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(ratio_group) %&gt;%\n  summarise(response_rate = mean(gave))\n\nresponse_rates\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  ratio_group response_rate\n  &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 1:1                0.0207\n2 2:1                0.0226\n3 3:1                0.0227\n\n\nThe 2:1 match increased giving by 0.19 percentage points over 1:1. The 3:1 match increased it by just 0.01 percentage points over 2:1.\nWhether we look at the raw data or the regression model, we find that increasing the match ratio from 1:1 to 2:1, or from 2:1 to 3:1, produces minimal and statistically insignificant increases in donation rates.\nThis confirms the central message in Karlan & List (2007):\n“The presence of a match increases giving, but making it more generous doesn’t help.” Fundraisers don’t need to secure a 3:1 match to succeed — just having any match at all is effective.\n\n\nSize of Charitable Contribution\nIn this subsection, I analyze the effect of the size of matched donation on the size of the charitable contribution.\n\n#_todo: Calculate a t-test or run a bivariate linear regression of the donation amount on the treatment status.

As more pairs are simulated, the line settles and smooths out, converging toward the true average treatment effect (0.004), marked by the red dashed line.\nBy the time we reach several thousand observations, the cumulative average stays consistently close to 0.004, illustrating the Law of Large Numbers in action. As the number of simulations grows, the cumulative average stabilizes and approaches the true difference in means — exactly what LLN predicts.\n\n\nCentral Limit Theorem\n\n#_to do: Make 4 histograms like those on slide 44 from our first class at sample sizes 50, 200, 500, and 1000 and explain these plots to the reader. To do this for a sample size of e.g. 50, take 50 draws from each of the control and treatment distributions, and calculate the average difference between those draws. Then repeat that process 999 more times so that you have 1000 averages. Plot the histogram of those averages. Comment on whether zero is in the \"middle\" of the distribution or whether it's in the \"tail.\"_\n\nset.seed(123)\n\n# Parameters\np_control &lt;- 0.018\np_treat &lt;- 0.022\nn_sims &lt;- 1000\nsample_sizes &lt;- c(50, 200, 500, 1000)\n\n# Load plotting library\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(purrr)\n\n# Simulate for each sample size\nsimulate_diffs &lt;- function(n) {\n  replicate(n_sims, {\n    control &lt;- rbinom(n, 1, p_control)\n    treatment &lt;- rbinom(n, 1, p_treat)\n    mean(treatment) - mean(control)\n  })\n}\n\n# Generate data for all sample sizes\nsim_results &lt;- map_dfr(sample_sizes, function(n) {\n  data.frame(\n    diff = simulate_diffs(n),\n    n = paste0(\"n = \", n)\n  )\n})\n\n# Plot histograms\nggplot(sim_results, aes(x = diff)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = \"#66c2a5\", color = \"black\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = \"red\", linetype = \"dashed\", linewidth = 1.2) +\n  facet_wrap(~n, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Sampling Distribution of Differences by Sample Size\",\n    subtitle = \"Red dashed line = no effect (difference = 0)\",\n    x = \"Difference in Proportions (Treatment − Control)\",\n    y = \"Count\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nn = 50: The distribution is wide and irregular, and zero is near the center. This means we can’t reliably detect a treatment effect with such small samples.\nn = 200: The shape becomes more symmetric and normal, but zero is still well within the main bulk, suggesting limited power.\nn = 500: The distribution tightens, and we begin to see a slight shift away from zero, meaning more consistent detection of the small true effect.\nn = 1000: The distribution is narrow and centered near the true effect (~0.004). Now, zero is closer to the tail, indicating we’d likely reject the null in a real hypothesis test.\nThese plots demonstrate that: With small sample sizes, statistical noise overwhelms the signal — it’s hard to detect real effects. As the sample size grows, the distribution of estimated differences narrows and zero moves into the tail, giving us more confidence in detecting true effects. This visualizes why large samples are crucial in experiments, especially when the effect size is small — like in this charitable giving study."
